        <h2>Everything is a Box</h2>
        <p>Each HTML element on a web page is represented as a
          box, known as the <b>CSS Box Model</b>, and is made up of four areas that define how
          elements are presented on the screen.</p>
        <p>These areas are: <b>Content</b>, <b>Padding</b>, <b>Border</b>, and
          <b>Margin</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Picture frames are one way to illustrate the CSS Box Model. Each of the box model areas
          correlate to an area in this picture of the Shiba Inu.
        </p>
        <figure class="article-image-container">
          <img src="/img/articles/box-model/doge-picture.webp"
               alt="Picture frame with a photo of a Shiba Inu">
          <figcaption>Picture frame with a photo of a Shiba Inu</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>This is the actual thing represented in the box on the web page, such as a paragraph of text or an image.
          It's
          the cute dog
          in the photo frame.</p>
        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>The area or space between the content and the border. It separates the dog picture from the border of
          the
          picture frame.</p>
        <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>The edge of the content and its padding. It's the physical frame in the picture that contains both the Shibu
          Inu and the space around it.</p>
        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>The space beyond the border. Used to provide spacing between one HTML Element, and another. Adding to the
          analogy, this would be the space between one picture frame and others around it.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>In the Browser</h2>
        <p>In practice, a HTML Element can be inspected to see each area's value by using the browser dev
          tools.</p>
        <div class="article-box-model-shiba">
          <img src="/img/articles/box-model/doge-without-frame.webp"
               alt="Photo of a Shibu Inu used to illustrate CSS Box Model concepts"
               class="article-shiba">
          <img src="/img/articles/box-model/box-model-dev-tools.webp"
               alt="Photo of box model in browser dev tools"
               class="article-box-model">
        </div>
        <p>Right clicking the Shibu Inu image and selecting <b>inspect</b> will launch the browser dev tools with
          the <b>elements</b> tab selected. On the right side is a <b>styles</b> tab, and scrolling to the bottom
          reveals an interactive display that lists the <i>calculated</i> values for content, padding, border, and
          margin dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>Since relative units like rem and em are often used for sizing <i>(rather than static pixel sizes)</i>, this
          provides a convenient way to
          inspect an element's dimensions in different states, such as on a desktop screen or a mobile phone display.
        </p>

        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The CSS Box Model is a key introductory concept to the world of CSS. Once it is understood that everything on
          a web page is made up of boxes, it becomes easier to view how each element is sized and its behavior
          around other elements.</p>
        <h3>Challenge:</h3>
        <p>Using the inspect tool, explore this page and find an example implementation of each of the four CSS Box
          Model areas. How do they interact? Does every element have a value for each of the four areas? Does specifying
          the value for one area <i>(for example, margin)</i> apply it to all sides of the element?</p>
