        <h2>Why Dark Mode?</h2>
        <p>Dark mode has become an increasingly popular option for websites. The ability to toggle between light and
          dark themes allows users to select a presentation that can reduce eye strain, improve device battery life, and
          match
          the aesthetic that the user prefers.</p>
        <p>In this article, you'll learn how to implement dark mode for a website using CSS Variables so that you can
          begin to provide this feature to your users.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>CSS Variables</h2>
        <p>The magic lies within CSS variables, which allows setting CSS values to a variable that can later be
          overwritten using Javascript.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/lee-cooper/42a257f5916b03739a3a2d8a731a55f4.js"></script>

        <p>For example, the above snippet sets a CSS variable (which can be named anything) on the root of the document
          and applies that variable to the body element's background-color, changing it to red. And since it's a
          variable, that means it can
          be changed.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, a toggle function can be set up to replace the light mode values with their dark mode
          counterparts.</p>
        <h3>Lab: Implement Dark Mode with CSS Variables</h3>
        <p>To start out, create a basic HTML document with a heading, some paragraph text, and a button that will
          be used to toggle the theme of the page. Take note of the id attribute on the button - this will be used later
          in the javascript file.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/lee-cooper/370a6a8f5bd3fa2c81a855f53736abe8.js"></script>
        <p>Next, using the --variable-name: syntax, create styles for the background, text, and accent colors. Then use
          the var(--variable-name) syntax on the h1, p, button, and body elements. This sets our elements to pull color
          styling values from the new CSS variables, and sets us up for the final step.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/lee-cooper/a2b9960a8cfae967bb6dcff452fa6e5b.js"></script>
        <p>Finally, attach a click event to the button via the button's id and toggle a .dark class on the root document
          element. When
          clicked, the :root will have the .dark class added, and because of its CSS specificity the dark mode values
          will be used in the document instead of the light mode values.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/lee-cooper/1fcda79ab5d3d0ab2e61bf27788a212a.js"></script>
        <p>If everything is set up correctly, when the project is run and the button is clicked, the theme will
          successfully switch from light to dark mode! Check out the Stackblitz for a working demo of this.</p>

        <h2>The Possibilities Are Endless</h2>
        <p>This short article outlined an approach to implement light / dark mode themes, which can be further
          expanded to support other custom themes. From the functional and accessible high-contrast themes, to the
          outright fun cotton-candy bubblegum-esque themes, CSS variables provide developers with a powerful and simple
          method to switch app appearances at the click of a button.</p>
        <h3>Challenge:</h3>
        <p>Design and add another theme to the CSS file and provide a mechanism to toggle this new theme on/off. Did
          this introduce any issues with the dark mode theme? If so, why? Do the names of the CSS variables cause
          confusion when being applied to other elements? If so, how could this be addressed?</p>
