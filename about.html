          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Lee Cooper. I'm a web developer with experience
            developing, deploying, and maintaining enterprise-level web
            applications, with a specialization in designing accessible and user-friendly interfaces and components.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I was introduced to software development during my second year of college, where I took an
            "Introduction to C++" course as an elective while I finished out the remainder of my classes for my
            business associates degree.</p>
          <p>After the first class, I was hooked.</p>
          <p>Switching my major, I went on to achieve my bachelors degree in Information Systems
            Technology at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale and accepted a position at
            Progressive Insurance as an IT Applications Developer.</p>
          <p>That one class offering began my journey of becoming a professional software developer, where I get to
            do what I love everyday - build software that changes the lives of others.</p>

          <h2>What Am I Up To Now?</h2>
          <p>In addition to my work at Progressive, my 2022 goals are to teach web development classes and
            create websites for local businesses in need of a web presence. This led to the creation of
            <a href="https://cooperweb.dev">cooperweb.dev</a> as a
            way to
            reach these goals.
